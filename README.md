# XChat-DeaDBeeF
XChat-DeaDBeeF is a Python plugin for XChat and HexChat. It implements commands to control the DeaDBeeF music player, directly from the text box.
It was initially developed in late 2011 and came back to life in May 2013.

###  How does it work?

XChat-DeaDBeeF implements a few commands that can be typed into the text box at any moment. 

Commands:

* **/deadbeef** - launches DeaDBeeF
* **/np** - displays current track in channel
* **/nextsong**, **/prevsong** - loads next/previous track in playlist
* **/playsong** - plays track or resumes playback (if paused)
* **/pausesong** - pauses track
* **/stopsong** - stops current track

### Requirements

Obvious programs are required:

* [Python 2.7.x](http://www.python.org/getit/ "Download Python") (or 2.6.x)
* [DeaDBeeF 0.5.x](http://deadbeef.sourceforge.net/download.html "DeaDBeeF - Ultimate Music Player For GNU/Linux")
* [XChat](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xchat/files/ "X-Chat - Browse Files at SourceForge.net") or [HexChat](http://hexchat.org/downloads.html "Downloads - HexChat") for Linux

_Note: XChat is no longer being actively developed. HexChat, one of its fork, is now the main project and receives regular updates._

Your distribution should propose packages for all of those programs; install them normally with your package manager.

If not, compile and install them from scratch.

### Installation

Installing XChat-DeaDBeeF is pretty straightforward.

* For XChat:
    1. Clone the Git repository to any folder (or, alternatively, download the source tarball).
    2. Move **XChat-DeaDBeeF.py** to **$HOME/.xchat2** (which contains all of your XChat plugins).

* For HexChat:
    1. Clone the Git repository to any folder (or, alternatively, download the source tarball).
    2. Move **XChat-DeaDBeeF.py** to **~/.config/hexchat** (which contains all of your HexChat plugins).

XChat-DeaDBeeF will now be automatically loaded upon launching XChat/HexChat.

_Note: if necessary, the plugin can also be (re)launched via Window > Plugins and scripts... > Load... > plugin location.*
